Welcome to the official documentation of *inkgd*, an implementation of Ink's
runtime for Godot, in pure GDScript.

The table of contents below, as well as the sidebar, should let you easily find
the topic you're looking for. If it's your first time using *inkgd*, we
recommend you start with :doc:`getting_started/introduction` first.

If you prefer a more hands-on approach, feel free to tinker with the
`example project`_ (*inkgd*'s repository is the example project itself).

.. _`example project`: https://github.com/ephread/inkgd/

.. note::

   *inkgd* has a .gitattributes file which makes sure that only ``addons/inkgd``
   is added to the Github archive. The only way to get the example folder and
   the project file is to clone the project.
